=== Comic Player v 0.4 ===
=== manual for WINDOWS BINARY DISTRIBUTION ===


QUICK INTRO
===========

The purpose of this application is simple.

It is not very convenient to read a comic (either scanned or digitally drawn) on a regular computer display. 
Usually vertical resolution is unsatisfactory and you have to zoom it (quality sucks) or scroll it (irritating).

This program can segment a comic page into individual panels and highlight them one by one (or row by row),
allowing you to navigate between them using the keyboard. Segmentation is performed automatically (via some quite dumb
and slow algorithm), but you can fix/adjust it manually.


SUPPORTED PLATFORMS
===================

Windows (XP, Vista - tested; 2000, 7 - should work)

To use this application in Linux - use source download


INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS - Windows, using prebuilt package
===========================================================

Download an installer and extract the files.

Go to the folder where you unpacked files to and launch cplayer.exe 


BASIC USAGE
===========

The workflow is like this:

1. Open a comic book (either a folder with image files or .cbz / .cbr file).

2. Start reading the comic.
